A **LEFT JOIN** in SQL retrieves all records from the **left table**
(the one before `JOIN`), and the matching records from the **right table**
(the one after `JOIN`). If thereâ€™s no match in the right table, it
returns `NULL` for those columns.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

### Example:

#### Tables:
**Users**
| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Alice |
| 2  | Bob   |
| 3  | Carol |

**Orders**
| id | user_id | product    |
|----|---------|-----------|
| 1  | 1       | Laptop    |
| 2  | 1       | Mouse     |
| 3  | 2       | Keyboard  |

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT Users.id, Users.name, Orders.product
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id;
```

#### Result:
| id | name  | product   |
|----|-------|----------|
| 1  | Alice | Laptop   |
| 1  | Alice | Mouse    |
| 2  | Bob   | Keyboard |
| 3  | Carol | NULL     |

Since Carol has no orders, `NULL` appears for the **Orders.product** column.

# Left-Join vs Correlated Subquery

A **correlated subquery** can sometimes replace a **LEFT JOIN**, but it depends
on the use case. Correlated subqueries can simplify certain queries, but they may
be **less efficient** than a `LEFT JOIN` because they execute once per row in
the outer query.

First prepare the sample dataset:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

INSERT INTO Users (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Carol'),
(4, 'David');

INSERT INTO Orders (id, user_id, product, order_date) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Laptop', '2024-01-10'),
(2, 1, 'Mouse', '2024-01-15'),
(3, 2, 'Keyboard', '2024-01-20'),
(4, 2, 'Monitor', '2024-02-01'),
(5, 3, 'Tablet', '2024-02-05');

```

---

### **Example 1: Using LEFT JOIN**
#### Scenario: Get each user's most recent order.

```sql
SELECT Users.id, Users.name, Orders.product, Orders.order_date
FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id
AND Orders.order_date = (
    SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM Orders WHERE Orders.user_id = Users.id
);
```

ðŸ”¹ **Pros**: More efficient in many cases (indexing helps).  
ðŸ”¹ **Cons**: Slightly more complex than a subquery.

---

### **Example 2: Using a Correlated Subquery**
```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    name, 
    (SELECT product FROM Orders o
     WHERE o.user_id = Users.id 
     ORDER BY order_date DESC 
     LIMIT 1) AS latest_product,
    (SELECT order_date FROM Orders o
     WHERE o.user_id = Users.id 
     ORDER BY order_date DESC 
     LIMIT 1) AS latest_order_date
FROM Users;
```

ðŸ”¹ **Pros**: More readable for simple lookups.  
ðŸ”¹ **Cons**: Runs a subquery **for each row**, which can be slow on large datasets.
